# JS Clock

### First of 20 JS Projects

First of JS Projects to complete to Strengthen my JS skills. 

The JS clock sends greetings and based on the time of the day and changes images as well. The sources of the images have been commented out in the JS code and the party time button left unresolved. Its purpose is essentially to initiate a party message and image "onclick".
